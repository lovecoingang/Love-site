        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Love is more than just a crypto - it's a movement built on giving back and creating a positive impact.
          75% percent of the initial mint is reserved for holder giveaways over time!  All future token releases will be given to the 
          holders, or be voted on by the community. <br> original NFTs also coming soon 
          <br>Launched July 29, 2025

        <h3>Economics</h3>
        <p>
          The Love token is designed for longevity — not a flash launch, but a purposeful path toward economic 
          empowerment and liquidity growth. Starting at 15% liquidity, this project flips traditional crypto norms by 
          intentionally growing liquidity through holder donations over time.<br>
          We're currently expanding liquidity toward a 30% target through milestone-based releases, 
          then we will gradually release a percentage of the reward pool annually to keep rewards coming while protecting
          the long term value of LOVE.
          <strong>Giveaway Schedule</strong>

        <h4>Low Liquidity Advantage</h4>
        <p>
          Launching with only 0.025 SOL in the pool wasn’t just a technical choice — it was a strategic move to protect early 
          adopters and prevent front-running bots from draining the pool. While trades are currently micro-sized (under $1), 
          this gives investors the opportunity to accumulate early.<br>
          Currently airdrops are manual and will be given within 24 hours for transparency and trust. As the liquidity 
          pool deepens and automation improves, so will the scale and simplicity of transactions.
