        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Love is more than just a crypto - it's a movement built on giving back and creating a positive impact.
          75% of the total supply is reserved for community giveaways.
          Our goal is to give back to both our holders and our community, and give the community the power to vote on the future outcome of most token releases
          <br>Launched July 29, 2025

        <h3>Economics</h3>
        <p>
          The Love token is designed for longevity — not a flash launch, but a purposeful path toward economic 
          empowerment and liquidity growth. Starting at a lean 15% liquidity, this project flips traditional crypto norms by 
          intentionally growing liquidity through community-oriented donations over time.<br>
          We're currently expanding liquidity toward a 30% target through milestone-based releases and incentive-driven growth. 
          Then will gradually release a percentage of the reward pool annually to keep rewards coming while protecting
          the long term value of LOVE.
        </p>
        <h4>Low Liquidity Advantage</h4>
        <p>
          Launching with only 0.025 SOL in the pool wasn’t just a technical choice — it was a strategic move to protect early 
          adopters and prevent front-running bots from draining the pool. While trades are currently micro-sized (under $1), 
          this gives investors the opportunity to accumulate early without major volatility.<br>
          Currently airdrops are manual and will be given within 24 hours for transparency and trust. As the liquidity 
          pool deepens and automation improves, so will the scale and simplicity of transactions.
