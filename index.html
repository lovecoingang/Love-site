        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Love is more than just a crypto - it's a movement built on giving back and creating a positive impact.
          75% of the total supply is reserved for community giveaways and events.
          Our goal is to empower holders through <strong>community voting</strong> on future initiatives, weekly rewards, and token burns.
          We will also be releasing a schedule soon for when we will be doing airdrops, giveaways, and votes!
        </p>
        <h3>LOW LIQUIDITY LAUCH</h3>
        <p>
          This is a low liquidity lauch to avoid liquidity pools being drained during launch, It started with just .025SOL, but with a committed community and a low market cap
          we can grow Love into a huge ecosystem with a lot of power to do good things.  With low liquidity we also currently have no smart contracts and airdrops will be done 
          manually within 24 hours.  As we grow this should improve.  Thank you for the support!
